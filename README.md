模拟三体运动
看了来自UTSC的应用“3D三体模拟系统”后，觉得很震撼，深深的被这些轨迹所吸引。因此也想自己编程做一款类似的软件，同时改进他们软件的一些缺点。包括但不限于：
1.初始化数据时填写麻烦，不能随机生成初始数据。
2.无法保存轨迹以供后面查看和更改。
3.坐标系固定，视角只能在第一卦限移动。
本开发大概需要很长时间，毕竟是单人边研究边编程，难免知识不足、时间不够等等，无法和他们相比，因此请读者多多谅解。

On seeing the application from UTSC,“3D三体模拟系统”(the stimulation of the 3body system),I felt deeply impressed by the mysterious tracks of these bodies.I am  inspired and so want to program a similar application.In the process of programming,I can improve their application as well.Their disadvantages include:
1.It is problematic to initialize the data because ramdomly initializing is not available.
2.The tracks stimulated can not be saved to be used for later checking and improving.
3.The coordinate system is fixed,and the view is limited in the first area of the 3dimensional coordinate system.

The programming of this application may last a very long time,because i need to learn the relative knowledge and program this all alone.It's inevitable that I may not have enough time to focus on it.Therefore,i hope that you,the readers,could wait patiently for me.Thank you.
